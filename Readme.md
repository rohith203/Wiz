# Image detection using keras and Resnet50

- resnet50_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5 weights have been used to make a convolutional neural network that detects content of an image.

- The user can upload images from their system
or take an image using the webcam and upload it.

- The results of detection are displayed in the frontend.
